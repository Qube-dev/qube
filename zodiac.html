  <h1>Zodiac 2020</h1>
  <h2>Aries</h2> <p>(March 21 – April 19)</p>
  <p>Your ruling planet, Mars, goes retrograde this year. However, being the warrior fire sign that you are, you come out on top, with more money than ever.</p>
  
  <h2>Taurus</h2> <p>(April 20 – May 20)</p>
  <p>Venus is your ruling planet, and it's going retrograde in 2020. Your job is not to be distracted by exes. They will try to haunt you this year, but you're above that.</p>
  
  <h2>Gemini</h2> <p>(May 21 – June 20)</p>
  <p>The energy of 2020 freaks you out at first when you find yourself wanting to focus on one partner instead of 20. There's nothing wrong with multiple partners, but with all the money-making opportunities in front of you, someone is on the chopping block.</p>

  <h2>Cancer</h2> <p>(June 21 – July 22)</p>
  <p>2020 is the year you stop people-pleasing. Go after your dreams, Cancer. If you don't, they might not be there for much longer.</p>
  
  <h2>Leo</h2> <p>(July 23 – August 22)</p>
  <p>You're a lion, Leo, and don't you forget it. 2020 requires strength — do not dull your shine for anyone. Those who try to cut you down get thrown to the sharks.</p>
  
  <h2>Virgo</h2> <p>(August 23 – September 22)</p>
  <p>You're the sign of service, Virgo, but 2020 asks you to step into a leadership role. Can you handle it?</p>
  
  <h2>Libra</h2> <p>(September 23 – October 22)</p>
  <p>You're all about relationships, from friends, to partners, to people you just flirt with over text. But this year, someone has to go. You can't do it all and make all this money.</p>
  
  <h2>Scorpio</h2> <p>(October 23 – November 21)</p>
  <p>Put down the stinger and turn on the charm. Go after what you want. This year asks you to practice emotional regulation for the sake of networking.</p>
  
  <h2>Sagittarius</h2> <p>(November 22 – December 21)</p>
  <p>You are so fabulous, Sagittarius, so why are you still hung up on your ex? Everyone has something to let go of this year, and yours is that unnecessary nostalgia.</p>
  
  <h2>Capricorn</h2> <p>(December 22 – January 19)</p>
  <p>2020 is your year, Capricorn. You basically own it. Does that turn you on? Good. Get started on that project you've had on the backburner.</p>
  
  <h2>Aquarius</h2> <p>(January 20 – February 18)</p>
  <p>2020 finds you dreaming of love — maybe even long-term commitment. Who are you and what have you done with our Aquarius rebel? Don't worry, you can have your metaphorical wedding cake and eat it too.</p>
  
  <h2>Pisces</h2> <p>(February 19 – March 20)</p>
  <p>You'll find yourself craving structure this year, but you might also want a new sexual partner. Stop swiping. 2020 introduces you to great people IRL, but it's up to you to get out there.</p>
